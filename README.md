# final-solo-rock-paper-scissors

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This app is a rock paper scissors game with two variations for the user to play. There is a traditional game and a 5 option variation game. The user plays against a computer and the wins of each round are annouced and tracked.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Fork and clone down this repository and run `open index.html` OR follow this [link](put link to page once public here)

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)


### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project was completed at the end of Mod 1 independently. I worked for approximatley 3-6 hours over 5 days to complete the project. Everything was built from scratch.

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The goal of this projetc was to combine our knowlege of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics to build a application from the ground up. The application needed to match a provided project spec, but there was felxibilty in design. All the code written should function wiht no bugs, and be DRY and readable.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
**WINS!**
I was proud that I completed this project completely independently and I was able to problem solve on my own. A big win was that I was unsure I would be able to do this, but through careful problem solving and taking steps on ata atime the project steadily came together.

**challenges**
I had a really hard time with planning out my work for this porject without the provided iterations that we had on previous projects. This meant it was hard for me to gauge how far along I was inthe porject as I went. To conteract this I repeadley revisted my plan and updated it as I went. I also strgguled intially to make the code DRY when wrting the winning conditionals for the game. I was able to make the code DRY by using a foor loop to iterate over an array of stored winning condtions.
